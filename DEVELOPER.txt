DEVELOPER NOTES
---------------

###### 1. An error in processing a sequence should break only the iteration of the loop, not the entire code execution.

###### 2. add ETS feature

###### 3. Write untitests for the functions in `ChecklistOps.py`

###### 4. Have the code automatically add non-mandatory qualifiers as separate columns
* Ensure that all features that are not mandatory are added as separate columns into the checklist output (and not dropped, as they are now)

###### 5. Die outlists in globale variablen speichern
